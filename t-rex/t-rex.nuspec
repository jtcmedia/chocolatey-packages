## Antivirus Alerts and Cryptocurrency Mining Warning

In order to protect the miner from reverse engineering attacks, the binaries in this miner are obfuscated like how real viruses are. Therefore, it may trigger an antivirus alert. See [here](https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex#antivirus-alerts). **Do not mine on a computer where you store your sensitive data.**
