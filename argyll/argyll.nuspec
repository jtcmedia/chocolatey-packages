    <description><![CDATA[ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available
as Open Source. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners,
cameras and film recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays
and RGB, CMY & CMYK printers. Device Link can be created with a wide variety
of advanced options, including specialized Video calibration standards
and 3dLuts. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of
illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive
compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut
mappings for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and
profile linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut
mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of rendering intents. It also
includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion
engine available anywhere, as well as support for fast, fully accurate
16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed and compared
with a modern Web browser using X3DOM . Comprehensive documentation is
provided for each major tool, and a general guide to using the tools for
typical color management tasks is also available. A mailing list provides
support for more advanced usage.
