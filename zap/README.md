## Package Note

**ZAP 2.16 or higher requires Java 17 or higher and that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set**. You can install a Chocolatey Java Package or Java from Oracle. One suggestion is the [Temurin17jre](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Temurin17jre) package. Ensure you install it with the `FeatureJavaHome` parameter set.

## Maintainer's Note

I produce and maintain Chocolatey packages in my spare time, for free. If you use my packages, and appreciate the time and effort I put into making and maintaining them, please consider [making a small donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jtcmedia). Thank-you!
