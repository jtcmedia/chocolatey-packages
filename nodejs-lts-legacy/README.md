Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

#### This package is the **LTS** (Long Term Support) release of Node.js. See the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule) for more information.

#### If you want the **Current** release, install the [nodejs](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs) package instead.
