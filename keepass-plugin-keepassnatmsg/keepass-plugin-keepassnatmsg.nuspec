    <description>
    
is a plugin for KeePass 2.x and provides a secure means of exposing KeePass credentials to a browser via [Native Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging).

It is based on [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp).

This plugin is primarily intended for use with the [keepassxc-browser](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser) browser extension.
