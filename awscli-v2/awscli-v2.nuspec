    <summary>The AWS CLI is an open source tool built on top of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) that provides commands for interacting with AWS services.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[# AWS Command Line Interface

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new [features](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cli-v2-is-now-generally-available/) including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), and various interactive features.
